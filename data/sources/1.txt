Read Your Way Through Italy – Summer Outfits Inspired by Novels

While everyone else is jet-setting across Europe, I’m taking a different kind of vacation—one that doesn’t require a passport, packed suitcase, or PTO request. This summer, I’m traveling through Italy one page at a time, with a stack of novels that whisk me from the Amalfi Coast to the hills of Tuscany, the romance of Lake Como to the secrets of Sicily. 

But of course, no literary journey is complete without the look to match. Each book on this list inspired a color-coordinated outfit that captures the mood, magic, and setting of the story. So whether you’re reading from your backyard or an actual beach in Positano, you are invited to read your way through Italy with me, and these “Booked Looks” are here to bring your fiction-fueled Italian summer to life. While these aren’t exactly Italian summer styles, they are absolutely options you can take inspiration from (and something I am going to be playing up on the blog all summer long)! Make sure to sign up for the email list so you are always in the know about additions to our fictional Italian adventure, and let’s get started on our tour!
