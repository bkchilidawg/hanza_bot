Everything I read in June 2024
June Reads, Ratings, and Book Reviews
How is June already over? I feel like the month flew by thanks to trips, adventures, and, of course, lots of fabulous reads. Today I will be sharing my June reads, ratings, and book reviews with you all, and there are some great ones that are perfect for reading next to the pool or on the beach!


Last month (May) I changed up the format of how I do my monthly reads & ratings posts. Let me just say ‚Äì I love how it turned out! It is so clean and organized, and allows yall to see how I personally enjoyed the book as well as access an easy way to shop if the book sounds like something you would enjoy, too.

2024 Reading Goals
Last year, I worked HARD to get to 52 books in 52 weeks (as inspired by this group I had found online)! I was proud to make it, but I will admit it ended up causing me to read because I had to rather than for it to be an outlet, which I hated. So this year ‚Ä¶ no reading goal!

I did manage to summarize my nine favorite fiction reads from the year into a post, though, so if you want to know what I recommend the most out of that haul, check that post out here!

4 stars  RomRa (Romance Drama)  Paperback

Enjoyed with Pinot on patios in the sweltering early summer Texas heat at sunset. 

I enjoyed the first two books in this series in April and the third and fourth in May. If you‚Äôve been keeping up with that, you know that I typically tend to favor books written towards Daisy‚Äôs point of view rather than Magnolia‚Äôs. That said, this book was great. I‚Äôd argue the best one in the series yet. Now I have to sit around and figure out what to do with my time until the next Daisy book is released (when?!).

What I loved:

I got to a point where I enjoyed Magnolia. It‚Äôs incredible what can happen when she and BJ aren‚Äôt fighting constantly (which I find toxic and frankly exhausting).
The book summed up the Magnolia side of the series perfectly. I wouldn‚Äôt want any more. This was just too good!
What I would have changed (no spoilers):

The length: this book had no business being over 700 pages long. 
The rambling style of writing ‚Äì particularly from BJ‚Äôs perspective. We get it. You love her and have for forever. I don‚Äôt need to read it 17 different times.

3.5 stars  Thriller  Kindle

Enjoyed on a beautiful patio in Illinois on a 75 degree summer day on a work trip.

The identity comes first and then the mission. When Evie Porter is approached by a woman at a party who identifies herself by Evie‚Äôs real name, things begin to unravel. What is going on, and is this a mission ‚Ä¶ or a game?

This book was twisty in ways I didn‚Äôt expect! That said ‚Ä¶ certain pieces seemed a little too ‚Ä¶ convenient? to be convincing. It is a great, low stakes read that is quick and easy. I highly recommend it for a long flight or for the beach side!

Local Woman Missing by Mary Kubica
Local Woman Missing book review - being read on a kindle next to some room service french fries

5 stars  Thriller Kindle

Enjoyed over too much room service on a work trip 

11 years ago, Delilah Dorsey‚Äôs mom was found dead with a suicide note, and Delilah went missing. Now, she has reappeared. Where has she been this whole time, and what really happened on that day she disappeared? 

Freaky reading this book about young women going missing from the Chicago burbs during an El Ni√±o year ‚Ä¶ while visiting the Chicago burbs on an El Ni√±o year. 

The first couple chapters of this book are a little rough, but I promise you, it‚Äôs so worth it. It becomes binge worthy and has a twist you won‚Äôt see coming. Completely fascinating.

3.5 stars  Thriller  Kindle

Enjoyed on a long plane flight back home.

This is the third book in The Housemaid series! 

This whole series is full of great, quick reads that are entertaining. I quite enjoyed how this one wrapped everything up and hosted a crew of repeat characters! This was a read-in-a-day type of book. I recommend these to anyone who is going on a flight soon. They‚Äôre the perfect length to keep you occupied but are easy to keep up with.

2.5 stars  Romcom  Paperback

Enjoyed on patios while trying not to think about the Texas heat

This book is by the same author as The Seven Year Slip (one of my Top 9 Fiction Reads from last year)! Check out my review here. 

Florence is the ghostwriter for an ultrafamous romance author who was born to a family who owns ‚Ä¶ a funeral home. Oh ‚Äì and she can talk to ghosts. When her father passes and she has to return home, a ghost comes with her to teach her something, she‚Äôs just not sure what. 

This book was just ‚Ä¶ not it for me. Maybe I‚Äôm just critical, but the main character having a ghost companion reminded me quite a bit of a child having an invisible friend ‚Ä¶ only this was supposed to be romantic? I can‚Äôt say I would recommend it. That said, Poston‚Äôs other book ‚ÄúThe Seven Year Slip‚Äù is a favorite of mine!

Not in Love by Ali Hazelwood

5 stars  Romcom  Paperback

Enjoyed in one day during lunch hour and quick breaks from my oversized reading chair.

This book was utterly perfect in every way a romcom should be. Anyone looking for a book that will make you believe true love actually can and does exist, this one‚Äôs for you ü§ç  (yes, I too absolutely hate the cover and could never read this in public).While I personally didn‚Äôt quite understand the character of Rue fully (or why a man like Eli would be so infatuated with her ‚Ä¶ she kinda bored me), I do see this happen often in day-to-day life so very relatable. 

That said, second half of book Rue was better than in the first half. I love that therapy is also such a huge part of the book (and it‚Äôs SPICY!!). Go in blind ‚Äì this book will delight you! 100% tied for first place for my favorite June read.

4.5 stars  Thriller  Kindle

Enjoyed while sweating profusely on a hot Texas weekend. 

I honestly quite loved this book. It was a twisty read with multiple viewpoints that all answered questions left open from previous ones. Though it started slow, it picked up quickly with the second viewpoint and only escalated from there. A great read for a hot summer day!
