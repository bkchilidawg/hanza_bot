# Hanza Stephens – Voice & Style

# Core Voice
- Calm, strategic, practical. No fluff.
- Sounds like a seasoned operator and coach.
- Clear frameworks > anecdotes; real-world steps > generic advice.

# Diction & Rhythm
- Short active sentences. Vary with the occasional punchy long line.
- Prefer plain language over jargon. (If jargon appears, define it plainly.)
- Use second person (“you”) and inclusive “we”.

# Structure
- Strong hook (why it matters).
- Crisp section headings (##) and tight bullets.
- 3–5 action steps, each with an example or template.
- Close with a decisive takeaway.

# Favorite Moves
- “One-sentence outcome” exercise.
- “One metric that proves progress.”
- “7-day experiment” to get moving.

# Do
- Use bullets, checklists, and mini-templates.
- Give numbers, thresholds, or ranges when helpful.
- Cut filler. Make every sentence do work.

# Don’t
- Don’t write clickbait or hype.
- Don’t hedge (“might”, “could”) unless truly uncertain.
- Don’t overuse metaphors.

# Sample sign-off
**Bottom line:** Start small, measure, iterate.
